# Hey

## Does Hey work on mobile? If so, how?

You’re in luck! You can currently access Hey on all mobile devices. We’re in the process of preparing the complete, polished version of the online extension, and a full mobile extension is in our 2019 roadmap. In the meantime, there’s a beta version of mobile access available. This allows you to see friends’ comments and to use Hey on sites for which owners have already partnered with the platform. Answers are already available on the road. Not while driving, please.

## **As a webmaster, how can I block Hey?**

Turns out we’ve made that a bit difficult. Why? First, because we stand behind our vision: the Internet should be openly accessible and moderated only when necessary \(see: for hate speech, threatening dialogue, etc.\). We believe it’s our duty to Internet users to increase their opportunities for engagement and assistance. In a world that has become increasingly individualistic, we’re doing our best to open borders rather than close them. Second, because we’re here for you. We’re supportive of the Internet community as a whole—this means users, of course, but also site owners \(who are, ultimately, users themselves\). Hey gives you the opportunity to interact with your customers and attract additional visitors. It’s a chance to engage 1:1, answer questions, earn trust, and build business and personal relationships that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to. It’s our honest belief that attempting to block the extension would do you—and your users, who might question why you’ve done so—harm. So, the real answer is this: as a site owner, you can detect the extension and choose to hide your site content until users have disabled Hey on their web browser, but we highly recommend that you don’t. Site visitors suspicious of bad intentions probably won’t do much good for your business. Just a guess.

## **As a webmaster, can I integrate Hey into my site?**

Ah, that’s what we like to hear. Of course—we’re happy to help you integrate Hey. You can do so by heading over to our admin page and following a few simple steps. 20 seconds, we swear. The extension will help increase user engagement via peer-to-peer exchange, strengthen user trust, and drive traffic by ensuring that all information is on a single website. The best part? It’s free. Cha-ching! 💰

## **Is Hey free?**

For you? We wouldn’t have it any other way.

## **How does Hey handle ‘fake news’ and bad behavior by platform users?**

Oh, the joys of a modern world. The Internet is an incredible tool—expanding globalization, facilitating innovation, and fostering community. And yet, it has its drawbacks. The speed and sum of ‘fake news’ making its way around the web is overwhelming and can often prove dangerous. We’ve incorporated features like the Overwatch, which allows reputable users \(those with a certain number of Karma points\) to report others for inappropriate behavior on the extension, including hate speech and threatening dialogue, among other activities. Reported users will then be put ‘on trial,’ where a select number of reputable users will decide whether or not the report is justified and, if so, suspend or otherwise penalize the defending user.

## **What is blockchain?**

You’ve decided to hit us with the hard stuff, huh? Here’s the deal: blockchain is a distributed, decentralized public ledger. It’s a data storage system that ensures certain data is safe from modification. It’s complex, and explaining it within an FAQ is unrealistic. Not to worry—we’re here to help. Luke Fortney wrote a killer piece for Investopedia that explains what blockchain is, how it works, its level of security, blockchain vs. bitcoin, et cetera. We highly recommend you check it out.

## **Why blockchain?**

So you’ve read the article above—or you have a friend, or you watched a video, or something of that nature—and you’re clear on what blockchain is and how it works. Next up: why? The Hey team is convinced that running parts of our app on the blockchain is the only way to fully accomplish our product vision. It’s also the only way we can ensure value is created for three important parties: the community, early backers, and our team. Two of our main principles are decentralization and transparency—both of which return power \(and profit\) to the people. Hey’s core feature of token-based, community-driven reward flows \(e.g. likes, comments, referrals, etc.\) allows for high-quality, user-generated content, increasing the product’s value for all network participants. Blockchain is also required in order to redistribute this user-generated value—in addition to that generated by advertisements—to the community in an auditable fashion. For this, blockchain offers the opportunity to use smart contracts. The party doesn’t stop there: blockchain allows us a faster speed to market \(higher security to avoid stolen value, saved architectural time for our tech team, legal and financial frictions reduced, …\). The real question is: why not?

## **Once I’ve earned HEY tokens, how do I use them?**

Money, money, money. It always comes back to the cash, doesn’t it? Or, rather, the crypto. Anyway, the point is that you can use HEY tokens for a number of activities. If it’s of interest, you can use the tokens to purchase advertising space on the platform—as the community continues to grow in size, this becomes an increasingly interesting buy. You can also trade your tokens for other crypto or fiat currencies on exchange platforms \(see below\).

## **What if cryptocurrencies crash? What about my tokens?, you ask.**

That situation is a bit of a doozy. Our belief is that the market’s behavior is, to a significant degree, separate from our service. Rather than being a direct representation of cryptocurrency market price, HEY tokens symbolize the value our community brings to the Internet and society at large. So, whether the market crashes or not, the project maintains relevance. HEY tokens function as a mechanism for user engagement but, once the user base is in place, revenue will be rooted in advertising and the social network—that is, Hey itself—will remain valuable both in its functionality for users and the opportunity for highly targeted ad placement. And finally: we have faith in the technology being used and the impressive blockchain-based projects making their way to the forefront of the crypto scene \(projects that solve real-world problems, from poverty to healthcare to supply chain management\). With that said, we quote the wise words of Nicholas Sparks’ The Notebook: “It’s the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee.”

## **What are Karma points?**

Let the gamification begin. Karma are points you earn for creating valuable content on the platform—adding comments, answering questions, flagging scams, et cetera. The more Karma you can acquire, the better. This is because Karma is reflected on your profile, having two immediate impacts: the first is peer trust, as your Karma represents a good chunk of your reputation on the platform, and the second is that good ol’ utility token. How does Karma turn to cash? Karma points are calculated at the end of each fixed time period, based on activities in which users have engaged \(that is, building valuable content\). In order to reward users for their Karma earned, there is a fixed number of HEY tokens \(taken from the POOL, which is constantly refilled by Hey’s advertising income\) that are distributed to users. Tokens granted correspond to each user’s proportion of the total Karma points earned across the platform in a given time period. At that point, users can feel free to use those tokens as they see fit—for advertising space, to be traded for other tokens, or to be exchanged for fiat currencies. Keep in mind that, while daily Karma earned will be wiped from the token-counting system and so set daily token counts back to zero in preparation for the following day, users’ total Karma earned will remain on their profiles and continue accruing as reputational representation.

## **What are HEY tokens?**

HEY tokens serve as a gamification tool to build our user base and, ultimately, are what we use to redistribute profit to the people. Tokens are closely linked to Karma \(see above\), as Karma earned each day—via creation of valuable content on the platform—are converted into HEY tokens that are deposited into users’ accounts at the end of every 24-hour period. These tokens can be used as users see fit—for advertising space, to be traded for other cryptocurrencies, or to be exchanged for fiat currency.

## **How am I compensated for creating valuable content on Hey?**

You, Hey users, are our raison d’être, as they say. The purpose of the project is to increase accessibility of peer-to-peer engagement and assistance—to open Internet borders \(and, perhaps, to flip a finger to the trolls\). We feel that the best way to do this is by ensuring that we incentivize so-called good behavior. For our team, that means providing a reward for posting helpful commentary, offering a word of advice, flagging scams, et cetera. Generally, it requires interaction rooted in positivity and support, as opposed to divisiveness or resentment. When our users take part in this type of activity, we provide them with Karma points—this can be for content they’ve created themselves \(comments and the like\) or for supporting other users in their good intentions \(via likes, for example\). Karma points and their use—as a reputational tool and in earning HEY tokens—are outlined in questions above. The point is: we’re striving for a better world...so much so that we’re willing to pay you for it. Take advantage. Be happy. Be good.

## **Where is Hey located and how can I get in touch?**

Well, technically, we’re everywhere. Funny how terrifying the Internet can be, isn’t it? As for the team, we’re on site in Brussels. Second to none \(note: in order to increase our cool factor, we have excluded Silicon Valley, Zug, alongside all other tech cities—not to worry, we recruited hard and pulled the best people to Belgium\). If you’re looking to send us some sweet goodies, we’re at Rue Arnaud Fraiteur 15-23, 1050 Brussels. Phone is +32 2 896 58 55. Team email addresses are on their page of our site, but general messages can be forwarded to info@hey.network. We’re all ears.

## **Is Marc Jacobs the Marc Jacobs? If so, what is he doing at Hey?**

He is not. Unfortunately, we got stuck with the fake Marc Jacobs. Marc Jacobs the imposter. Bit of a downer, considering most of the team signed on for the free hand bags. You win some, you lose some.
