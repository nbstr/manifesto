# Use cases

Hey is a unique entry point to every page on the web. Unlike on existing platforms, Hey users are able to interact with existing content in its original context, free of censorship. It is a social network, live chat, and forum system all in one.

To put it simply, Hey is exactly what Facebook, Intercom, and Reddit would be if they joined forces.

Like Facebook, Hey enhances social interactions through comments on discussion feeds, replies, and notifications. Like Intercom, Hey allows users to ask questions related to the web page they visit at a precise moment. And just like Reddit, comments are vouched for by users, so that the best content is more visible. Everyone can express their opinions freely, via votes for ideas, tips, or reviews.

Hey carries a massive number of concrete applications. Below are some specific ways Hey may have an impact in different industries.

### **Scams, Hacks, Malware, Security**

More and more websites hack your computer without you noticing: they steal your data, install a virus or malware, and read your cookies to spy on your browsing behavior, among other activities.

Hey extension will allow users to report scams and frauds whether websites owners like it or not, thus helping you avoid unsolicited hacking or tracking.

### **Tutorials**

Too often, Internet users get discouraged by the obstacles they encounter while learning new skills. They reach a certain hurdle that they just can’t get over, and so end up abandoning the endeavor, when perhaps all they needed was a bit of peer insight. Many times, other users browsing the same website at the same moment hold the answer they need.

On the other hand, when browsing forums or tutorial websites, experienced users often come up with creative suggestions that can prove helpful to others.

Perhaps you’re watching a video on how to code Python and keep coming across the same bug, so want input from other coding students. There’s likely a senior coder poking around somewhere – looking for a junior employee, merely expanding their skill set – who’s going to come across your beginner question. With Hey, they can answer you directly, giving direct and immediate access to the advice you needed.

Maybe you want to make an Indian recipe but recall that your last endeavor was lacking in taste. Post on the platform, and a niche chef can respond accordingly, cluing you in that a bit more cardamom really does the dish justice.

A platform for interaction ensures that all online spaces offer a forum for users to exchange advice and experiences.

### **E-commerce**

Today, when you buy goods online, you must find a way to check if the seller is reliable. Before transfering money to confirm your purchase, you—quite rightly—assess the risks \(when will I receive my package? will the product fit the description on the website? will it be damaged?\). Websites like eBay and Amazon know this—that is why they built reputation tools like review sections, which helped them gain their customers’ trust.

Unfortunately, millions of sites have no comments or rating systems. Hey directly addresses this issue by facilitating exchanges between online shoppers on all websites, thus reducing risk and misunderstandings.

### **Documentation and Troubleshooting**

Developers share countless modules on the Internet, often with limited background information attached. Imagine how delightful it would be to receive the answers you need on the same web page, via other users who have already jumped the hurdle.

With Hey, you can attach a code snippet \(text in a programming language displayed in a way that is easy to read and copy\) and discuss code specificities seamlessly.
