# HEY token sale

### Token Sale

The token sale will launch in February 2019 using an ERC20 token standard. We will release a fixed number of 500 million HEY tokens for public sale. The remaining token supply will be rendered inaccessible, with 30% allocated to the rewards pool and the rest elsewhere, as outlined below in the Token Distribution table.

The token sale will end either on a pre-set date or, if prior to this date, when the 500-million-token hard cap is reached. At this time, the smart contracts acquisition \(ICO\) will be closed. Token buyers will have the possibility of keeping their HEY tokens in any ERC20-compatible wallet until further exchange listings are secured.

### Token Distribution

| **Percentage** | **Allocation**  | **Date of Issue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 50% | Public Token sale | Token Distribution Event \(ICO\). |
| 30% | Pool | Regularly, based on distribution formula. For user reward purposes. |
| 10% | HEY team | Locked up over a 2-years period, to guarantee the Hey team’s complete involvement in the project. |
| 5% | Early investors | Locked up over a 2-years period, proportionately to their initial investment \(from EUR seed round\). |
| 3% | Contributors | Token Distribution Event \(ICO\)—to translators, designers, marketers, and early contributors who helped us build the project. |
| 2% | Advisors | Locked up over a 2-years period,, to experienced professionals who provided their time and advice. |

### KYC Process

The ICO KYC process relies on industry standards and aims to guarantee the quality of the initial community. At the moment of writing and due to legal restrictions, all countries are welcome to participate in KYC except for Bosnia-Herzegovina, China, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, South Korea, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, the USA, Vanuatu and Yemen.

### Transfers and Exchange Listing

Tokens will be made transferrable as soon as the ICO closes.

The Hey team will initiate discussions with potential exchange partners in order to secure a listing in the months after the ICO's end. Having an efficient exchange will be key to fulfilling the Hey vision of circular economics—where advertisers can buy tokens in exchange for ads displays, ultimately contributing to the rewards pool.

### Unsold Tokens and Post-ICO Token Allocation

After the ICO closes, potentially remaining unsold tokens will be transferred to the distribution Pool \(which will furthermore be endowed with 30% of the Total Supply\).

As indicated in the [Tokenomics](https://manifesto.get-hey.com/hey-token) section of the Manifesto, the Hey team will distribute a predetermined portion of the Pool to Hey’s most active and credentialed users after the ICO is closed, on a periodic basis. HEY token distribution will subsequently be ported to the Blockchain.

### Token Acquisition Summary

The sections above, as well as previously noted in this Manifesto, outline the 3 ways one can obtain HEY tokens:

* Buying them during the ICO
* Buying them on exchange platforms after the ICO
* Earning them through our reward and referral programs
