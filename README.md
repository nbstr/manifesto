The Internet is all about content — it's everywhere and in all forms. In spite of its abundance, accessing accurate information is harder than one might think. This is precisely the issue: searching for reliable information in a content-heavy arena is not as easy as it ought to be. Our objective is to change that.

Hey aims to provide Internet users with three improvements: context, increased frequency of P2P interactions, and improved transparency practices. It is a web application that provides a social network available on the very same page you are browsing. Our tool works as a web browser extension, and can also be installed as a widget on your website. You can find as many use cases to Hey as there are pages on the world wide web: help from fellow developers, comments on products, reviews for courses, warnings, endorsements, are a few of many.

Hey's reward and referral system is one of its cardinal strengths and serves as our principal engagement tool. Users receive a certain amount of HEY tokens proportional to their engagement. This system not only encourages users to participate in discussions, but also gives fair compensation to content creators.

At Hey, we believe there are countless behind-the-scenes communities on every website, all waiting to be uncovered — our goal is to publicize and empower them.
