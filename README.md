The web isn't what it once was: it seems we've gone from young, wild, and free to strict, old, and in bed by 20.30.  ðŸš€

The Internetâ€”a place we learned to read, write, and roam freeâ€”is growing more censored by the day, full of fools declaring _fake news_ and forcing valuable information to be covered up or taken down. We're here to say _Hey,_ not cool. It's time to soften up, search for our roots, and take back control. We want a new Internet normâ€”positive impact and supportive interaction.

That's why we created Heyâ€”a platform that provides undisturbed access to your peers and is built on transparency. Hey adds a top layer to the Internet onion, functioning as an extension on users' browsers that nestles into the right side of each web page. The platform is a place to share ideas, advice, and insight. For example, to comment openly on available products and discounts accessible elsewhere, find help from fellow developers, or warn virtual friends of site scams. The major bonus: the Hey extension can't be removed or edited by site owners themselves, so your input will never be altered or erased based on their agendas. The only time anything gets amended is when it's deemed harmful to the health of the platformâ€”hate speech and its foul friendsâ€”by other users. Even then, there are tools in place to minimize the risk of misreporting.

We take democracy to the next level, incorporating a reward and referral system as well as karma points accrual in order to redistribute value to the users who create it. Power to the people? Yeah, that, and then some profit to the people.  

Hey is here to make change happen and to promote liberty on the World Wide Web. We want you on board.
