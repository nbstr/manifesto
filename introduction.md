# Introduction

Social media has two options - public or private. Go public, you’re doing the digital equivalent of standing outside and shouting into the void while hoping someone shouts back through thousands of people doing the same thing. There’s no control, no nuance, and anyone can interact with you.  Go private and it’s the opposite - you can’t interact with anyone and they can’t interact with you. It’s a frustrating binary between two choices without a bridge in between – until now.

Introducing Hey, where you don’t have to make that choice. Think of Hey as a building with rooms. Inside one room is your family. In another, your friends. You can seamlessly communicate with both without overlap. What does this mean for you? Well, say good-bye to friend requests from grandma or mom snooping through your timeline. And for that matter, forget overloaded dashboards too. With Hey’s unique network structure, you see - and put out - exactly what you want.

### Semi-public concept

The semi-public concept is the compromise between the unfiltered public nature of post-based social media and the limited opportunities to build communities in private social media. Networks create segmentation within the user base, letting people easily devote themselves to only the stream of information that they’re interested in. However, networks aren’t closed doors either; users can easily access other networks and keep track of certain channels inside them. This all means that although networks create natural hubs around  a central idea, users aren’t beholden to them. In essence, a user can pick and choose exactly what they want to see while still having access to the entirety of Hey.Network and best of all, what they post in one network won’t crossover into another. This is all just fancy talk for Grandma isn’t gonna see anything too risque for her eyes, thank god.

### Organizational control

Hey is built on networks. Anyone can be in a network and anyone can make a network, with no cap on how many members it has and administrative control left up to the network master. Inside each network, you have channels. Depending on the needs of that network, these channels can be organized by topic, date, name, and so on. This is to create a communicative environment that is easy to navigate to reduce one of the biggest frustrations of modern social media, i.e. the overload of information.
