# Introduction

Just ten years ago, social media was still considered a novelty. Even though more and more people were getting on-board, concepts like influencers, Instagram models, live news Tweets, and social media campaigns only came later, once the entire world began to realize the unfettered access that the digital sphere had to an individual. Following that explosion, people have gotten a lot more savvy about what they put out and where. But even that’s enough, not when so many of these social media giants have built their entire business model around the invasion and monetization of privacy. But even so, doesn’t it destroy the point of social media to create closed networks?

So what is Hey? It’s a mobile app that’s \(soon\) coming to web browsers. Consider it the next step forward for social media, giving people the tools they need to build their own places.

### Semi-public concept

The semi-public concept is the compromise between the unfiltered public nature of post-based social media and the limited opportunities to build communities in private social media. Networks create segmentation within the user base, letting people easily devote themselves to only the stream of information that they’re interested in. However, networks aren’t closed doors either; users can easily access other networks and keep track of certain channels inside them. This all means that although networks create natural hubs around  a central idea, users aren’t beholden to them. In essence, a user can pick and choose exactly what they want to see while still having access to the entirety of Hey.Network and best of all, what they post in one network won’t crossover into another. This is all just fancy talk for Grandma isn’t gonna see anything too risque for her eyes, thank god.

### Organizational control

Hey is built on networks. Anyone can be in a network and anyone can make a network, with no cap on how many members it has and administrative control left up to the network master. Inside each network, you have channels. Depending on the needs of that network, these channels can be organized by topic, date, name, and so on. This is to create a communicative environment that is easy to navigate to reduce one of the biggest frustrations of modern social media, i.e. the overload of information.
