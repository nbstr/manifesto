### HAC System

#### What the HAC?

We take our current and future users' security very seriously. That is why we built a mechanism to ensure our system is reliable and secure.

The semi-automated Hey Anti-Cheat System \(HAC System\) is continuously enriched by our community and is responsible for uncovering "cheaters' tricks."

#### How it works

In order to deal with fraudulent "like farms" \(groups of users that get paid to like posts\) and other troll behaviours, we came up with various scripts and additional tools to review bot behaviours.

#### Flags

HAC scripts are able to detect suspect behaviours, which are automatically flagged and reviewed by Hey’s internal team. Let's consider, for instance, detecting like farms. In order to spot suspicious behaviour quickly, we created a script to identify and map likes. If one user receives too many likes too fast, or if he/she receives too many likes coming from the same people on the same posts, he/she is flagged. The user then appears as "suspect" in our system.

We have developed several additional techniques to discern bot behaviors. For security reasons, we won’t go into further detail here.

#### Hey Troll Court \(HTC\)

In addition to our automatic flagging system, Hey community members can report unusual or excessive behaviours. While we may all have different opinions, points of view, or feelings when facing sensitive issues, it doesn’t mean we should defame, insult, or disrespect at each other. Unfortunately, some of us seem to think otherwise, and do so very candidly. The Internet folks have even coined a word for them: trolls.

Even though Hey has been designed to encourage users to be helpful to each other \(via rewards, credibility points, reviewing flagged user behavior, etc.\), we came up with penalties in case some users’ behavior damages the network’s good nature.

On Hey, everybody has the opportunity to report toxic behaviors, comments, or users by filing a suit on which the community will render a judgment. This is basic crowd regulation — the ultimate measure of democracy, in which users' judgment is in their own hands.. The credibility we give to these reports will be based on the number of users reporting the same bad behaviors, as well as their reputation in the network.

If the reported user is cleared of the suit, the case is closed and no penalty is imposed. However, if the Hey community finds him/her guilty, the user is banned from the network, either temporarily or forever depending on if he/she is reported repeatedly. The team at Hey will review every imposed ban before applying the sentence, in order to ensure that they are rightful and legitimate.

Thanks to combined community efforts, we can rest assured that Hey remains a safe, healthy space for all users. We named this crowd regulation system the Hey Troll Court.

#### AI

Based on our users' reports, we will collect data enabling our artificial intelligence system to detect frauds more efficiently in the future.

#### Overwatch

Users from all over the world will have the opportunity to engage in the Overwatch program, through which they will assess "villain" profiles \(i.e. repeatedly reported users\).

In order to avoid influencing the community's judgment, the "villain's" identity will remain confidential – only his/her words will be taken into account. Users will vote based solely on reported content, and a decision will be made accordingly.

The users whose votes align with the end result will gain Experience Points, which provide additional privileges within the app, while users who consistently vote against the verdict will lose points.

#### Terms of use

A user may be banned from the Hey community and/or legally prosecuted for any one of the following reasons:

* Hacking, extortion or attempted extortion, terrorism, murder, sexual abuse, or other criminal activity.
* Racism, harassment, violence, incitement to hatred, suicide, or mutilation.
* Posting nudity, explicit violence or sexual content.
* Identity theft.
* Intellectual property infringement.

### Opportunities for the Site Owner

Some website owners may fear the dangers of offering such freedom to users who might engage in uncensored or unmanageable conversations.

On the contrary, we believe that Hey offers an opportunity for site owners to grow their communities. The reality is, enabling transparency increases user engagement.

With Hey, site owners can also identify specific influencers easily. The platform can spot these particular users and provide information to the site owner, allowing them to reach out and build partnerships quickly and efficiently.

Besides, with Hey, site owners needn’t be scared of trolls and scammers. Our HAC system tackles this sort of issue, freeing up time and energy otherwise spent managing them. That is, the community manages itself.

Still, site owners can log into Hey as 'webmasters,' given that they provide their website credentials. Having done so, they can turn on notifications and be tagged as “webmaster” in the discussion thread. That way, in case it applies, users can identify website owners as credible authority figures to whom they can ask questions.
