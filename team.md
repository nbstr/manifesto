Olivier began his career by launching an alternative assets investment fund focused on classic cars. There, he worked as a co-founder and fundraiser, securing €1M and striking a balance between financial analytics and operational expertise. He later moved to Chicago and worked for a Private Equity Search Fund. He encountered blockchain technology for the first time at a neighborhood meetup and dove in, quickly raising money and creating a small cryptocurrency fund for friends and family to invest. He’s since moved back to Belgium and started his time at Hey, where he uses his analytical, operational, and technological skills to manage a growing team.

### Thomas Vanderstraeten, Blockchain Tech Lead

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-vanderstraeten-5710a148/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-vanderstraeten-5710a148/)

Thomas started his career spending three and a half years advising tech CEOs and CTOs at Bain & Company, the world's \#3 management consulting firm. After running the gamut of projects in a formal tech role, he traded his suit and tie for lumberjack shirts, smoothies, and nights of coding. He has since launched several tech ventures. Thomas combines a strategic and structured vision with the willingness to get his hands dirty in implementation details of sophisticated blockchain systems. He has a particular taste for the Ethereum protocol, but likes to keep his options open.

### Robin Poncin, Software Engineer & Sysadmin

Robin started hacking at 10 years old. Through trojans and exploits, he learned to master offensive security, server management, and backend development in Java, Xamarin, Python, NoSQL, MongoDB, big data, Node.js, sysadmin, AWS, npm, Bash, Linux, Android, and PHP. 

### Thomas Collart, Full-Stack Developer

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomascollart/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomascollart/)

Thomas began coding at a young age—tinkering around on the family computer and building sample websites without an audience in mind. The interest stuck,  and he jumped into a rigorous coding environment at École 42, for which he credits his autonomy and willingness to try, fail, and try again. He built his expertise as a digital nomad, building mobile apps like Raid Boss. Along the way, he’s obtained T-shaped skills and acquired a deep knowledge in full-stack web and mobile development, as well as design, marketing, and blockchain technologies.

### Emily Bogen, Head of Public Affairs

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilybogen/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilybogen/)

Emily is an American-born writer who began her stint in the startup circle just one year ago. After completing two fellowships and publishing a book in the U.S., Emily moved to Brussels and began working for a pan-European startup association as Communications and Policy Coordinator. She now spends half-time at ESN, complementing her work as Hey's Head of Public Affairs. 

### David Carliez, Computer Security Expert

David has been passionate about security and programming from a young age. He has a deep understanding of a wide variety of software and hardware technologies, and passed his OSCP certification the same year he obtained his bachelor’s degree. Even with his professional person established, his social side isn't to be underestimated: he'll spend 9-5 \(and then some\) working on information security projects, then follow it up with a Capture the Flag competition.
