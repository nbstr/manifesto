Thomas started his career spending three and a half years advising tech CEOs and CTOs at Bain & Company, the world's \#3 management consulting firm. After running the gamut of projects in a formal tech role, he traded his suit and tie for lumberjack shirts, smoothies, and nights of coding. He has since launched several tech ventures, one of which raised €1M+. Thomas combines a strategic and structured vision with the willingness to get his hands dirty in implementation details of sophisticated blockchain systems. He has a particular taste for the Ethereum protocol, but likes to keep his options open.

He has a deep understanding of a wide variety of software and hardware technologies, and passed his OSCP certification the same year he obtained his bachelor’s degree.
