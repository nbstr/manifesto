# Roadmap

#### Q4 2017: Beta version

The beta version of the extension was made available on Chrome Web Store. Our beta testers gave us feedback so we could improve features and user experience.

#### November 2018: Whitelist opens

To avoid transactions delay due to network clogging, we will open a whitelist where you will be able to register to participate in the ICO before its official launch.

#### December 2018: Token sale launch

The ICO starts on December 1st, 2018. You can then buy HEY tokens until January 2nd, 2019.

#### Q2 2019: Hey community grows

Thanks to you, our first users will become active on the network and across the Internet.

#### Q3-Q4 2019: Other communities join

As described in our growth strategy, we will extend the network by attracting other communities step by step.
