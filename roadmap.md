# Roadmap

#### Q4 2017: Beta version

In **\(MONTH\)** 2017, the Beta version of the Hey extension was made available on Chrome Web Store. Our beta testers gave \(**YOU STILL HAVE BETA TESTERS, NO? THEY CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU FEEDBACK? HOW?**\) us feedback so we could edit features and improve the user experience.

#### November 2018: Whitelist opens

To avoid transaction delays due to network clogging, we will open a whitelist where you \(**YOU MEAN WHO EXACTLY? NEED TO REPLACE 'YOU.'\)** will be able to register to participate in the ICO before its official launch.

#### December 2018: Token sale launch

The ICO will start on December 1st, 2018. You \(**WHO'S 'YOU'? REPLACE.**\) will then be able to buy HEY tokens until January 2nd, 2019.

#### Q2 2019: Hey community grows

Thanks to you \(**SAME ISSUE**\), our first users will become active on the Hey network and \(**WHAT DOES 'AND' MEAN HERE? ISN'T THE NETWORK ACROSS THE INTERNET?**\) ****across the Internet.

#### Q3-Q4 2019: Additional communities join

As described in our growth strategy, we will extend the network by attracting additional communities step by step.
