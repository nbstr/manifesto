# Roadmap

#### Q4 2017: Beta version

In March ****2017, the Beta version of the Hey extension was made available on Chrome Web Store. Our beta testers gave us feedback so we could edit features and improve the user experience.

#### November 2018: Whitelist opens

To avoid transaction delays due to network clogging, we will open a whitelist where token buyers will be able to register to participate in the ICO before its official launch.

#### December 2018: Token sale launch

The ICO will start on December 1, 2018. Token buyers will then be able to buy HEY tokens until January 2, 2019.

#### Q2 2019: Hey community grows

Thanks to token buyers, our first users will become active on the Hey network and across the Internet.

#### Q3-Q4 2019: Additional communities join

As described in our growth strategy, we will extend the network by attracting additional communities step by step.
